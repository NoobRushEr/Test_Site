      <p>
        This festival is celebrated in the Hindu month of Kartikamasam which
        falls sometime during October or November. It is celebrated to mark
        the return of Lord Rama after 14 years of exile and his victory over
        the Demon Ravana. In many parts of India, Deepawali is celebrated for
        five consecutive days. Hindus regard it as a celebration of life and

        floors.

        “Dugga Dugga “echo the united voices of all the ladies in the
        household as they move towards the pandals for pujo, wishing for a
        safe journey ahead in life. The sound of intense beats coming from the
        dhak mixed with the aroma of the dhunuchi lit in every house, park or
        corner fills the streets of Kolkata. Clad in the most beautiful
        attires, adorning the heaviest of jewels and thickest of bangles with
        sindoor and bindis on their temple, the women seem to walk a step
        ahead of the men today. After all, Durga pujo is the day of the Devi.
