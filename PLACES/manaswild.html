            <h2>Manas Wildlife Sanctuary</h2>
            <p>Manas National Park is a national park, UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site, a Project Tiger reserve, an
                elephant reserve and a biosphere reserve in Assam, India. Located in the Himalayan foothills, it is
                contiguous with the Royal Manas National Park in Bhutan. The park is known for its rare and endangered
                endemic wildlife such as the Assam roofed turtle, hispid hare, golden langur and pygmy hog. Manas is
                famous for its population of the wild water buffalo.
                The Manas National Park was declared a sanctuary on 1 October 1928 with an area of 360 km2. Manas bio
                reserve was created in 1973. Prior to the declaration of the sanctuary, it was a reserved forest called
                Manas R.F. and North Kamrup R.F. It was used by the Cooch Behar royal family and Raja of Gauripur as a
                hunting reserve. In 1951 and 1955, the area was increased to 391 km2. It was declared a World Heritage
                Site in December 1985 by UNESCO. Kahitama R.F. the Kokilabari R.F. and the Panbari R.F. were added in
                the year 1990 to form the Manas National Park. In 1992, UNESCO declared it as a world heritage site in
                danger due to heavy poaching and terrorist activities. On 25 February 2008, the area was increased to
                500 km2. On 21 June 2011, it was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger and was commended for
                its efforts in preservation.
