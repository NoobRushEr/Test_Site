            <h2>Archaeological site of Nalanda</h2>
            <p>The Nanda Devi National Park or Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, established in 1982 is a national park
                situated around the peak of Nanda Devi (7816 m) in Chamoli Garhwal district of Uttarakhand, in northern
                India. The entire park lies at an elevation of more than 3,500 m (11,500 ft) above mean sea level.
                The National Park was inscribed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988. It was later expanded and
                renamed as Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks in 2005.
                Within the National Park lies the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, a glacial basin surrounded by a ring of peaks
                between 6,000 metres (19,700 ft) and 7,500 m (24,600 ft) high, and drained by the Rishi Ganga through
                the Rishi Ganga Gorge, a steep almost impassable defile.
                The National Park is embedded in the 2,236.74 km2 (863.61 sq mi) sized Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve,
                which, in turn, is encompassed in the 5,148.57 km2 (1,987.87 sq mi) buffer zone around the Nanda Devi
                and Valley of Flowers National Parks UNESCO site.
                The best time to visit Nanda Devi National Park is from May to October.
                The first recorded attempt to explore the sanctuary was in 1883 by W. W. Graham, who could proceed only
                up to Rishi Ganga.[1] Other attempts by explorers in 1870, (T. G. Longstaff) 1926, 1927 and 1932 (Hugh
                Ruttledge) did not fetch fruitful results. Eric Shipton and H. W. Tilman entered the inner sanctuary
                through Rishi Ganga in 1934, thus opening the extensive exploration in the sanctuary. In 1939, the area
                was declared as a game sanctuary.
