            <h2>Hampi</h2>
            <p>Hampi or Hampe, also referred to as the Group of Monuments at Hampi, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site
                located in east-central Karnataka, India.
                Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century. Chronicles left by Persian and
                European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, say that Hampi was a prosperous, wealthy and grand
                city near the Tungabhadra River, with numerous temples, farms and trading markets. By 1500 CE,
                Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's second-largest medieval-era city after Beijing, and probably India's
                richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal. The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated
                by a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered, pillaged and destroyed by sultanate
                armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins.
                Located in Karnataka near the modern-era city of Hosapete, Hampi's ruins are spread over 4,100 hectares
                (16 sq mi) and it has been described by UNESCO as an "austere, grandiose site" of more than 1,600
                surviving remains of the last great Hindu kingdom in South India that includes "forts, riverside
                features, royal and sacred complexes, temples, shrines, pillared halls, mandapas, memorial structures,
                water structures and others".
