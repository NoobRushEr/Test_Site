            <h2>The Taj Mahal</h2>
            <p> The Taj Mahal  'Crown of the Palace', is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river
                Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r.
                1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan
                himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a
                guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of
                the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
                entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be
                approximately ₹70 billion (about U.S. $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000
                artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad
                Ahmad Lahauri.
                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art
                in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by
                many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal
                attracts more than 6 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders
                of the World (2000–2007) initiative.
