            <h2>Sundarbans</h2>
            <p>The Sundarbans National Park is a national park, tiger reserve and biosphere reserve in West Bengal,
                India. It is part of the Sundarbans on the Ganges Delta and adjacent to the Sundarban Reserve Forest in
                Bangladesh. The delta is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the
                Bengal tiger. It is also home to a variety of bird, reptile and invertebrate species, including the
                salt-water crocodile. The present Sundarban National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarban
                Tiger Reserve in 1973 and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. On 4 May 1984 it was declared a national park.
                It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site inscribed in 1987, and it has been designated as a Ramsar site since
                2019. It is considered as a World Network of Biosphere Reserve (Man and Biosphere Reserve) from 1989.
                The first forest management division to have jurisdiction over the Sundarbans was established in 1869.
                In 1875 a large portion of the mangrove forests was declared as reserved forests under the Forest Act,
                1865 (Act VIII of 1865). The remaining portions of the forests were declared a reserve forest the
                following year and the forest, which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was
                placed under the control of the Forest Department. A forest division, which is the basic forest
                management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with the headquarters in Khulna, Bangladesh. The
                first management plan was written for the period 1893â€“1898.
