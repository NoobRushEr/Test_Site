            <h2>Agra Fort</h2>
            <p>Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of
                the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the
                British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was life
                inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister
                monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as the walled city.
                Like the rest of Agra, the history of Agra Fort prior to Mahmud Ghaznavi's invasion is unclear. However,
                in the 15th century, the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital
                when Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487–1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in
                the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort
                and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during
                the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556–1605).
