            <h2>Ajanta Caves</h2>
            <p>
                The Ajanta Caves are approximately 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments dating from the 2nd century BCE
                to about 480 CE in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra state in India. The caves include paintings
                and rock-cut sculptures described as among the finest surviving examples of ancient Indian art,
                particularly expressive paintings that present emotions through gesture, pose and form. The Ajanta Caves
                are mentioned in the memoirs of several medieval-era Chinese Buddhist travellers to India and by a
                Mughal-era official of Akbar era in the early 17th century. They were covered by jungle until
                accidentally "discovered" and brought to Western attention in 1819 by a colonial British officer Captain
                John Smith on a tiger-hunting party. The caves are in the rocky northern wall of the U-shaped gorge of
                the river Waghur, in the Deccan plateau. Within the gorge are a number of waterfalls, audible from
                outside the caves when the river is high. With the Ellora Caves, Ajanta is one of the major tourist
                attractions of Maharashtra. It is about 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from Fardapur, 59 kilometres (37 miles)
                from the city of Jalgaon, Maharashtra, India, 104 kilometres (65 miles) from the city of Aurangabad, and
                350 kilometres (220 miles) east-northeast of Mumbai. Ajanta is 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the Ellora
                Caves, which contain Hindu, Jain and Buddhist caves, the last dating from a period similar to Ajanta.
                The Ajanta style is also found in the Ellora Caves and other sites such as the Elephanta Caves,
                Aurangabad Caves, Shivleni Caves and the cave temples of Karnataka.
