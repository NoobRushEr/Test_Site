            <h2>Kaziranga National Park</h2>
            <p>Kaziranga National Park is a national park in the Golaghat, Karbi Anglong and Nagaon districts of the
                state of Assam, India. The sanctuary, which hosts two-thirds of the world's great one-horned
                rhinoceroses, is a World Heritage Site. According to the census held in March 2018 which was jointly
                conducted by the Forest Department of the Government of Assam and some recognized wildlife NGOs, the
                rhino population in Kaziranga National Park is 2,413. It comprises 1,641 adult rhinos (642 males, 793
                females, 206 unsexed); 387 sub-adults (116 males, 149 females, 122 unsexed); and 385 calves.
                In 2015, the rhino population stood at 2401. Kaziranga is home to the highest density of tigers among
                protected areas in the world, and was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006 (now the highest tiger density is
                in Orang National Park, Assam). The park is home to large breeding populations of elephants, wild water
                buffalo, and swamp deer. Kaziranga is recognized as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International for
                conservation of avifaunal species. When compared with other protected areas in India, Kaziranga has
                achieved notable success in wildlife conservation. Located on the edge of the Eastern Himalaya
                biodiversity hotspot, the park combines high species diversity and visibility.
                Kaziranga is a vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf
                forests, criss-crossed by four major rivers, including the Brahmaputra, and the park includes numerous
                small bodies of water. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, songs, and documentaries. The park
                celebrated its centennial in 2005 after its establishment in 1905 as a reserve forest.
