            <h2>Mountain Railways of India</h2>
            <p>The Mountain railways of India are the narrow-gauge railway lines that were built in the mountains of
                India.
                Three of them, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, the Nilgiri Mountain Railway, and the Kalka–Shimla
                Railway, are collectively designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name "Mountain Railways
                of India". The fourth railway, the Matheran Hill Railway, is on the tentative list of UNESCO World
                Heritage Sites. All four are narrow-gauge railways, and the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is also the only
                rack railway in India.
                Three railways, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, the Nilgiri Mountain Railway, and the Kalka–Shimla
                Railway, are collectively designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name Mountain Railways of
                India. The fourth railway, the Matheran Hill Railway, is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage
                Sites.
                The basis of UNESCO's designation of the Mountain Railways of India as a World Heritage Site is
                "outstanding examples of bold, ingenious engineering solutions for the problem of establishing an
                effective rail link through rugged, mountainous terrain." The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway received the
                honor first in 1999 by UNESCO followed by the Nilgiri Mountain Railway in 2005. The Kalka–Shimla Railway
                received the designation in 2008. The three routes together have been titled the Mountain Railways of
                India under UNESCO World Heritage Site criteria ii and iv, within the Asia-Pacific region. The Matheran
                Hill Railway, a fourth mountain line, has been nominated and is pending approval by the international
                body.
