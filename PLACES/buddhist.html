            <h2>Buddhist Monument at Sanchi</h2>
            <p>Sanchi is a Buddhist complex, famous for its Great Stupa, on a hilltop at Sanchi Town in Raisen District
                of the State of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is located in 46 kilometres (29 mi) north-east of Bhopal,
                capital of Madhya Pradesh.The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India, and
                an important monument of Indian Architecture. It was originally commissioned by the Mauryan emperor
                Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple hemispherical brick structure built
                over the relics of the Buddha. It was crowned by the 'chhatra', a parasol-like structure symbolising
                high rank, which was intended to honour and shelter the relics. The original construction work of this
                stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha. Sanchi
                was also her birthplace as well as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. In the 1st century BCE, four
                elaborately carved toranas (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were
                added.
                The Sanchi Stupa built during Mauryan period was made of bricks. The composite flourished until the 11th
                century.
                Sanchi is the center of a region with a number of stupas, all within a few miles of Sanchi, including
                Satdhara (9 km to the W of Sanchi, 40 stupas, the Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana, now enshrined
                in the new Vihara, were unearthed there), Bhojpur (also called Morel Khurd, a fortified hilltop with 60
                stupas) and Andher (respectively 11 km and 17 km SE of Sanchi), as well as Sonari (10 km SW of Sanchi).
                Further south, about 100 km away, is Saru Maru. Bharhut is 300 km to the northeast.
                Sanchi Stupa is depicted on the reverse side of the Indian currency note of â‚¹200 to signify its
                importance to Indian cultural heritage.
